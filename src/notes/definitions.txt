DATA MODELING TYPES 

Type = a constraint on what values are allowed 
    -runs at compile time 
    -should not change 

    type Expense = number;

Interface = a constraint on how objects should be shaped 
    -this is more flexible
    - meant to be extended 

! use types for data constraints/logic 
! object meant to grow use interface  

Union Type = a type that can be one of several values 

    type Status = "idle" | "loading" | "error";

Discriminated Union = A union of object types that share a common literal property (the discriminant)

    type Result =
    | { status: "success"; data: string }
    | { status: "error"; message: string };


Type Narrowing = process of reducing a union type to be more specific

    if (object.status === "error") {
    object.fallback; // TS knows exactly what this is
}

Type Guard = a function that narrows a type 

Exhaustive Check = process that ensures all cases of a union are handled 

    function assertNever(x: never): never {
    throw new Error("Unhandled case");
    }

Literal Type = a type that allows exact values  

    type Direction = "up" | "down";

Intersection Type = a type that combines multiple types into one 
    - can fail if types conflict 

Generics (type) = a type that takes other types as parameters 

Optional Property = a property that may or may not exist


Never = create a value that should never exist or a code path that can't happen; throw an error if it does 

Illegal state = a combination of values that should never be possible 

Readonly = when a value is meant to be read only, avoids unwanted mutation


Unknown = better alternative to any; used when we don't know what type data we are going to be dealing with 

Any = a fallback that should not be used; completely bypasses type safety 

Non null assertion = when you tell typescript trust me bro this is not null; should not be used often 


Type Inference = when typescript assumes what constraints you want to apply 

Structural Typing = Typescript does not care about what something is named, it cares about how its shaped 


Derived State = data that can be calculated from other data
